Hi, It's 25 days to the Nigerian general elections.
I thought it will be a good idea to get a feel of what the electorates are feeling like, the electorates on twitter at least.
I am going to be exploring tweets around the 3 leading presidential candidates, trying to analyse their level of social media acceptance and popular sentiment about them.
Let's goo!
